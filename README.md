# Lite-Brite App

![alt text](Lite-Brite-1.jpg)

Did you have a Lite Brite growing up? If not, maybe you saw it in the latest season of Stranger Things. This front-end only app is a digital Lite Brite.
I built this to:
- practice modern redux patterns
- practice/learn typescript
- configure my own build from scratch (instead of using create-react-app)
- ...and to just have fun!
